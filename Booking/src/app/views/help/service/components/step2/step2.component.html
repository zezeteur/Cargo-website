    countries. If a User has any questions about the fees or any exchange rate

      Some airlines enter into "code share" agreements with other Airlines. This
      means that on certain routes, the airline carrier selling or marketing the
      flight ticker does not fly its own aircraft to that destination. Instead,
      it contracts or partners with another airline to fly to that destination.
      The partner airline is listed as "operated by" in the booking flow.
